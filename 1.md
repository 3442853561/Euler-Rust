#Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

This is a very easy problem.
You could solve it with the knowledge that you learn in primary school.
for example:

    fn main() {
        let mut sum = 0;
        for i in 1..1000 {
            if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 {
                sum = sum + i;
            }
        }
        print!("sum={}", sum);
    }

But if you are a wise man, you will do so:

    fn main() {
        let sum_3 = (3 + 999) * 333 / 2;
        let sum_5 = (5 + 995) * 199 / 2;
        let sum_15 = (15 + 990) * 66 / 2;
        print!("sum={}", sum_3 + sum_5 - sum_15);
    }

You may be asked the reason for doing so,
I will told you:

First, you must know 3 is the smallest multiple of 3 and 999 is the biggest multiple of 3 below 1000.
So, you could know 5 is the smallest multiple of 5 and 995 is the biggest multiple of 5 below 1000.

Next, you should know the Gauss sum formula,
we learn it in the primary school, right?

Last, please add the multiples of 3 and 5.
Don't forget minus the part of the repeat.
